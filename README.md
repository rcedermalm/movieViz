# MovieViz
A movie visualization tool for comparing your favourite movies. The project was done during the course TNM048 Information Visualization. 
The data used came from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) and contained around 4600 data points.

The visualization method is a self made method where each movie is represented as a star with the following properties: 
* The number of spikes represents how much the movie earned. 
* The size of the star represents how high the movie scored. 
* The colours in the background represents which genres the movie is in.
* The number of circles around the star represents how long the movie is, where each circle represents 30 minutes.

The idea behind the project was to make it easier for a person to be able to compare a movie to another in a fast way. 
The project got nominated for Best Research Potential in CAwards 2018.
